A simple matrix calculator in C, no UI.        
The matrices (A, B) are initialized by generating random numbers.

You can choose between different options: 

        1. sum 2 matrices (A+B)
        2. sub 2 matrices (A-B)
        3. multiply 2 matrices (AxB)
        4. multiply a matrix by a user-given scalar value (AxNum)
        5. find the transpose of a matrix (At)
        6. find the rank of a matrix (r(A)) - WIP - 
	0. exit the program


It's a little project to practice a bit of programming and C while preparing math-focused exams for UNI. Might expand it someday.
