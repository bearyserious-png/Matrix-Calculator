A simple matrix calculator in C, no UI. 
The matrix (A, B) is initialized by generating random numers.

You can choose different options: 
        * *sum 2 matrices (A+B)
        * sub 2 matrices (A-B)
        * multiply 2 matrices (AxB)
        * multiply a matrix by a user-given scalar value (AxNum)
        * find the transpose of a matrix (At)
        * find the rank of a matrix (r(A))* - WIP - 


It's a little project to practice a bit of programming and C while preparing math-focused exams for UNI. Might expand it someday.
